    One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled
    dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into
    a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back,
    and if he lifted his head a little he could see his
    brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into
    stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide
    off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin
    compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about
    helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he
    thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human
    room although a little too small, lay peacefully
    between its four familiar walls.
