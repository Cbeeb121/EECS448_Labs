List of known bugs:

1. isEmpty will return true for any size of LinkedList. We expect it to be false if size is greater than 0
but it returns true regardless.

2. BOTH removeBack and removeFront don't remove elements from the list. They also return true in any case.

3. addBack adds to the front, not to the back.
